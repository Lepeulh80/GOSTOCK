# Full Features Added

This project now includes:
- Supabase authentication components (SignIn, SignUp) and an AuthProvider.
- Client-side form validation for sign-up and product forms (basic checks).
- Server-side API skeleton for sensitive operations (uses SERVICE_INTERNAL_SECRET and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY server-side).
- Recharts sample chart for reports/dashboard.
- Updated package.json with Recharts dependency.

Important security notes:
- NEVER commit SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to source control or expose it to the browser.
- Use server-side functions or serverless endpoints to perform any operations requiring elevated privileges.
- The provided API handler `src/pages/api/secure_recompute.js` is a skeleton and must be adapted to your hosting environment (Next.js, Vercel, etc.).

How to run:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-only)
   - SERVICE_INTERNAL_SECRET (shared secret header to call secure endpoints)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
